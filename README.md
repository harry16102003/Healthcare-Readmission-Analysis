# 🏥 Healthcare Patient Readmission Analysis

An end-to-end **Data Science and Business Intelligence** project focused on analyzing patient readmission data. This project implements a full pipeline—from **data ingestion** and **analysis** to **predictive modeling** and **interactive visualization**—to deliver actionable insights into healthcare operations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective is to analyze a healthcare dataset and identify factors contributing to **patient readmissions within a 30-day window**. The project concludes with a trained **XGBoost-based machine learning model** that predicts readmission risk and a **Streamlit web app** to demonstrate real-time predictions.

## 🧰 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Database Setup
- Use SSMS to create tables using the SQL scripts in `sql_query/`.
- Import CSV files from the `dataset/` directory into your SQL tables.

### 2️⃣ Python Environment
- Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
- Install required dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 3️⃣ Run Streamlit App

* Navigate to the `app/` directory and run:

  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
* The app will open in your web browser, allowing you to interact with the model.

---

## 🧠 Model Details

The predictive model is a **tuned XGBoostClassifier** trained to estimate the risk of patient readmission. Key features used:

* **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Ethnicity
* **Admission Details**: Length of Stay, Admission Type
* **Discharge Information**: Discharge Disposition (e.g., home, rehab, nursing facility)

### 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics:

* **Accuracy**
* **Precision**
* **Recall**
* **F1-Score**

All performance metrics are displayed in the **Power BI dashboard** and used for interpreting the model’s effectiveness.

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard has been created to provide business insights. It includes:

* Readmission KPIs
* Filters by patient demographics and discharge types
* Visualizations for high-risk segments
* Model performance metrics and decision-support charts
