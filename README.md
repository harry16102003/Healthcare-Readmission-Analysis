# Healthcare-Readmission-Analysis
An end-to-end data science project on healthcare patient readmission analysis. I used SQL for data management, Python (XGBoost) for predictive modeling, Power BI for data visualization, and Streamlit to deploy a real-time prediction web application. The goal was to identify and predict patient readmission risk.
